# Quest（Avalon2）Rules

## Basic Rules 

### Factions
- Good Side (Arthur's Layal Servents, Blue Team): Must achieve 3 successful missions, or identify the Evil Side
- Evil Side (Mordred's Minions, Traitors, Red Team): Must cause 3 mission failures

### Game Objective
- Good Side accumulates 3 successful missions → Direct victory
- Evil Side sabotage 3 missions → Enter "Final Identification Phase"

## Round Flow
Each round consists of three phases:
1. Leader Selects Mission Members
   - Leader directly appoints mission members (no voting required)
   - Leader assigns a "Magic Token" to one member (forces them to vote for success, but Morgan Le Fay may ignore it), every leader can use it once

2. Mission Voting
   - Selected members secretly vote "Success" or "Failure"
   - Good Side must vote for success
   - Evil Side can choose to vote for success or failure. When a Magic Token is used, they must vote for success (Morgan Le Fay can ignore Magic Tokens)

3. Transfer of Leadership
   - Leader passes the "Leader Token" to a player who has not yet been the leader

## 特殊机制

2. Final Identification Phase
   - If the Evil Side sabotaged 3 missions:
     1. All players nominate two different players as Evil
     2. If the Good Side correctly identifies all Evil players → good side victory


## Strategy Highlights
- Good Side: Must prove their loyalty, analyze other players' identities, and ensure mission success as much as possible; also, strive to identify Evil players to potentially turn the tide in the final identification phase.
- Evil Side: Must sow confusion, use character abilities (e.g., Morgana) to disrupt judgment, sabotage missions and hide their true identity to avoid being correctly identified in the final phase.
- General Tips: Analyze logical inconsistencies in dialogues, observe mission outcomes and voting patterns, track Magic Token usage, and monitor leader transitions—these can all reveal players' identities.
